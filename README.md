# Solidity Learning


Currently working on a treasure chat gifting full stack application.

This will store an amount of a token to be received by someone with a specific ENS/address when they enter the site.

## Next Steps
- Implement https://github.com/Web3Modal/web3modal
- Look into GraphQL APIs for ethererum https://dev.to/dabit3/building-graphql-apis-on-ethereum-4poa
- Convert everything over to the treasure chest concept
-- This will involve storing tokens in a wallet/vault to be collected by someone receiving a link. They will need a specific wallet address to unlock and receive the booty!
